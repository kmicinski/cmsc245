<a href="http://www.grace.umd.edu/">GRACE</a> cluster.
You should download and install <a href="http://racket-lang.org">Racket 6.10</a> for development on
your own machine. Assignments must run correctly on this version of Racket.</p><p>All project submissions will be graded solely based on the results
obtained by the submit server. As your own machine may be setup somewhat
differently, it is strongly recommend that you should complete the assignment
well in advance of the deadline and ensure it is working by checking it against
the public tests via <a href="http://submit.cs.umd.edu">submit.cs.umd.edu</a>.</p><h4><a name="(part._.Office_.Hours_and_.Web_.Forum)"></a>Office Hours and Web Forum</h4><p>Office hours for the instructional staff will be posted on the course
web page within a few days into the semester.</p><p>While we will provide assistance with assignments during office hours,
you are responsible for developing and debugging your own programs. Do
not rely on the instructional staff to make your project work.</p><p>Important announcements will be made in class or on the class web
page. Please make it a habit to check the class web page daily. You
may also use the class web forum to ask general questions of interest
to the class as a whole, e.g., administrative issues or project
clarification questions. Please do not post any information that would
violate the university academic integrity policy.</p><h4><a name="(part._.Grading)"></a>Grading</h4><p><span class="refelem"><span class="refcolumn"><span class="refcontent">Assignments, projects, and exams will not be graded on a curve,
however final letter grades may be. The grades server will provide you

on the class web page, including announcements, deadlines, policies,
etc. During the semester we may provide ungraded practice homework
exercises and solutions. While we will not collect these exercises,
completing them is essential preparation for exams. You may work
together on these ungraded homeworks, and you may of course come to
office hours for additional help.</p><p>Your final course grade will be determined according to the following
percentages:</p><p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><p>Assignments &amp; projects</p></td><td><p><span class="hspace">&nbsp;</span></p></td><td><p>70%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Midterm</p></td><td><p><span class="hspace">&nbsp;</span></p></td><td><p>15%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Final</p></td><td><p><span class="hspace">&nbsp;</span></p></td><td><p>15%</p></td></tr></table></p><p>Any request for reconsideration of any grading on coursework
<span style="font-weight: bold">must</span> be submitted within <span style="font-weight: bold">one week</span> of when it is
returned. Exam regrading requests must be made in writing. Any
coursework submitted for reconsideration may be regraded in its
entirety, which could result in a lower score if warranted.</p><p>Final course grades will be curved as necessary, based on each
student&rsquo;s total numeric score for all coursework at the end of the
semester. <span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Completing the programming assignments is
an essential part of the course. Therefore, <span style="font-weight: bold">we may fail any
student who does not make a good-faith attempt on all course
projects</span>, regardless of the student&rsquo;s performance or scores on the
other coursework.</p><h4><a name="(part._.Programming_.Projects)"></a>Programming Projects</h4><p>Projects must be submitted electronically following the instructions
given in class. Projects <span style="font-weight: bold">may not</span> be submitted by any other
means (e.g., please do not email your projects to us). It is
<span style="font-weight: bold">your responsibility</span> to test your program and <span style="font-weight: bold">verify that
it works properly</span> before submitting. All projects are due at
11:59:59pm on the day indicated on the project assignment, according
to the submission server&rsquo;s internal clock. Projects will not be accepted
late unless by special permission given in advance.</p><p>Project extensions will not be granted due to system problems, network
problems, power outages, etc., so do not wait to submit a project
until the night it is due. You may submit multiple times up to the
deadline, and only your last on-time submission is graded. Similarly,
if you submit late, only your last submission before the deadline will
be graded. No consideration in
grading will be made for errors made in transferring files or
submitting the wrong version of your project. Having a working,
unsubmitted version will not count; only submitted code will be be
counted.</p><p>Unlike lower-level programming classes, we will not always provide you with
test cases before projects are due. Instead, you will be responsible
for developing your own techniques for testing your projects. To
reiterate: your projects will be graded based on test cases not
provided in advance. Because grading is done automatically, you must
follow the project specification exactly. Also, while projects will
generally not be graded on style or documentation, we reserve the
right to manually grade program source code for some projects.</p><p>Finally, any "hard coding" in a project assignment will result in a
score of zero for that project, and is considered a bad-faith
effort. Hard coding refers to attempting to make a program appear as
if it works correctly, when in fact it does not. One example of hard
coding would be printing the desired output instead of computing
it. This is only one example, and if you have any questions as to what
constitutes hard coding, be sure to ask ahead of time.</p><h4><a name="(part._.Exam_.Scheduling)"></a>Exam Scheduling</h4><p>The class includes a midterm and a final exam. Dates for the exams
are posted on the <a href="Schedule.html" data-pltdoc="x">Schedule</a>.  The date of these exams is
tentative and may change based on the University Registrar.
Confirmation of an exam date will be posted on the schedule
at least two weeks in advance of any exam.</p><h4><a name="(part._.Excused_.Absences)"></a>Excused Absences</h4><p>Besides the policies in this syllabus, the University&rsquo;s policies apply
during the semester. Various policies that may be relevant appear in
the <a href="http://www.umd.edu/catalog">Undergraduate Catalog</a>.</p><p>If you experience difficulty during the semester keeping up with the
academic demands of your courses, you may consider contacting the
Learning Assistance Service in 2201 Shoemaker Building at (301)
314-7693. Their educational counselors can help with time management
issues, reading, note-taking, and exam preparation skills.</p><p>Any student who needs to be excused for an absence from a single
lecture, recitation, or lab due to a medically necessitated absence
shall: a) Make a reasonable attempt to inform the instructor of
his/her illness prior to the class. b) Upon returning to the class,
present their instructor with a self-signed note attesting to the date
of their illness. Each note must contain an acknowledgment by the
student that the information provided is true and correct. Providing
false information to University officials is prohibited under Part
9(i) of the Code of Student Conduct (V-1.00(B) University of Maryland
Code of Student Conduct) and may result in disciplinary action.</p><p>The self-documentation may not be used for the Major Scheduled Grading
Events as defined below and it may only be used for only 1 class
meeting during the semester. Any student who
needs to be excused for a prolonged absence (2 or more consecutive
class meetings), or for a Major Scheduled Grading Event, must provide
written documentation of the illness from the Health Center or from an
outside health care provider. This documentation must verify dates of
treatment and indicate the timeframe that the student was unable to
meet academic responsibilities. In addition, it must contain the name
and phone number of the medical service provider to be used if
verification is needed. No diagnostic information will ever be
requested. The Major Scheduled Grading Events for this course include
project deadlines and any midterm or final exam.</p><p>It is the University&rsquo;s policy to provide accommodations for students
with religious observances conflicting with exams, but it is
<span style="font-weight: bold">your responsibility</span> to inform the instructor <span style="font-weight: bold">in advance</span>
of intended religious observances. Written notice must be provided
<span style="font-weight: bold">immediately</span> upon an exam date being announced or confirmed in
order for an absence to be excused. If you have a conflict with one of
the planned exams, you <span style="font-weight: bold">must</span> inform us prior to the end of the
first two weeks of the class.</p><p>For missed exams due to excused absences, the instructor will arrange
a makeup exam. However, unless <span style="font-weight: bold">immediate</span> notice is given as
early as possible of the reason for any missed coursework, an excused
absence may not be granted. If you might miss an exam for any other
reason other than those above, you must contact the instructor
<span style="font-weight: bold">in advance</span> to discuss the circumstances. We are not obligated
to offer a substitute assignment or to provide a makeup exam unless
the failure to perform was due to an excused absence.</p><p>The policies for excused absences <span style="font-weight: bold">do not</span> apply to project
assignments. Projects will be assigned with sufficient time to be
completed by students who have a reasonable understanding of the
necessary material and begin promptly. In cases of <span style="font-weight: bold">extremely
serious</span> documented illness of <span style="font-weight: bold">lengthy duration</span> or other
protracted, severe emergency situations, the instructor may consider
extensions on project assignments, depending upon the specific
circumstances.</p><h4><a name="(part._.Students_with_.Disabilities)"></a>Students with Disabilities</h4><p>Students with disabilities who have been certified by
<a href="http://www.counseling.umd.edu/DSS/">Disability Support
Services</a> as needing any type of special accommodations should see the
instructor as soon as possible within the first two weeks of class.
All arrangements for exam accommodations as a result of
disability <span style="font-weight: bold">must</span> be made and arranged with the instructor
<span style="font-weight: bold">at least</span> three business days prior to the exam date, or
accommodations <span style="font-weight: bold">will not</span> be made.</p><h4><a name="(part._.Academic_.Integrity)"></a>Academic Integrity</h4><p><span class="refelem"><span class="refcolumn"><span class="refcontent">Don&rsquo;t cheat. Just don&rsquo;t do it.

following statement on each examination or assignment in every
course: "I pledge on my honor that I have not given or received any
unauthorized assistance on this examination (or assignment)."
Consequently, you will be requested to include this pledge on each
exam and project. Please also carefully read the Office of Information
Technology&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.nethics.umd.edu/aup/">policy</a>
regarding acceptable use of computer accounts.</p><p>Programming projects are to be written <span style="font-weight: bold">individually</span>, therefore
cooperation or use of unauthorized materials on projects is a
violation of the University&rsquo;s Code of Academic Integrity. <span style="font-weight: bold">Any
evidence</span> of this, or of unacceptable use of computer accounts, use of
unauthorized materials or cooperation on exams or quizzes, or other
possible violations of the Honor Code, <span style="font-weight: bold">will be submitted</span> to the
Student Honor Council, which could result in an XF for the course,
suspension, or expulsion.</p><ul><li><p>For learning the course concepts (including the programming
languages), students are welcome to study together or to receive help
from anyone else. You may discuss with others the project
requirements, the features of the programming languages used, what was
discussed in class and in the class web forum, and general syntax
errors. Examples of questions that would be allowed are "Does a Java
class definition end in a semicolon?" or "What does a &rsquo;class not
found&rsquo; error indicate?", because they convey no information about the
contents of a project.</p></li><li><p>When it comes to actually writing a project assignment, other
than help from the instructional staff a project must solely and
entirely be your own work. Working with another student or individual,
or using anyone else&rsquo;s work <span style="font-weight: bold">in any way</span> except as noted in this
paragraph, is a violation of the code of academic integrity and
<span style="font-weight: bold">will be reported</span> to the <a href="http://shc.umd.edu/SHC/">Honor
Council</a>. You may not discuss design of any part of a project with
<span style="font-weight: bold">anyone</span> except the instructor or teaching assistants. Examples
of questions you may <span style="font-weight: bold">not</span> ask others might be "How did you
implement this part of the project?" or "Please look at my code and
help me find my stupid syntax error!". You may not use any disallowed
source of information in creating either their project design or
code. When writing projects you are free to use ideas or <span style="font-weight: bold">short
fragments</span> of code from <span style="font-weight: bold">published</span> textbooks or <span style="font-weight: bold">publicly
available</span> information, but the specific source must be cited in a
comment in the relevant section of the program.</p></li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Violations of the Code of Academic Integrity may include, but are not limited to:</span></p><ol><li><p>Failing to do all or any of the work on a project by yourself,
other than assistance from the instructional staff.</p></li><li><p>Using any ideas or any part of another person&rsquo;s project, or
copying any other individual&rsquo;s work in any way.</p></li><li><p>Giving any parts or ideas from your project, including test
data, to another student.</p></li><li><p>Allowing any other students access to your program on any
computer system.</p></li><li><p>Transferring any part of a project to or from another student or
individual by any means, electronic or otherwise.</p></li></ol><p>If you have any question about a particular situation or source then
consult with the instructors in advance. Should you have difficulty
with a programming assignment you should <span style="font-weight: bold">see the instructional
staff in office hours</span>, and not solicit help from anyone else in
violation of these rules.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">It is the responsibility, under the honor policy, of anyone who
suspects an incident of academic dishonesty has occurred to report it
to their instructor, or directly to the Honor Council.</span></p><p>Every semester the department has discovered a number of students
attempting to cheat on project assignments, in violation of academic
integrity requirements. Students&rsquo; academic careers have been
significantly affected by a decision to cheat. Think about whether you
want to join them before contemplating cheating, or before helping a
friend to cheat.</p><p>You are welcome and encouraged to study and compare or discuss their
implementations of the programming projects with any others after they
are graded, <span style="font-weight: bold">provided that</span> all of the students in question have
received nonzero scores for that project assignment, and if that
project will not be extended upon in a later project assignment.</p><h4><a name="(part._.Course_.Evaluations)"></a>Course Evaluations</h4><p>If you have a suggestion for improving this class, don&rsquo;t hesitate to
